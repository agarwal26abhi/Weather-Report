An NOAA dataset has been stored in the file data/C2A2_data/BinnedCsvs_d400/fb441e62df2d58994928907a91895ec62c2c42e6cd075c2700843b89.csv. 
The data for this assignment comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical 
Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across
the globe.
Each row in the assignment datafile corresponds to a single observation.
The following variables are provided to you:	
•	id : station identification code
•	date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
•	element : indicator of element type
	TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
	TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
•	value : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)
•	A line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014 is drawn. The area 
between the record high and record low temperatures for each day is shaded.
•	Overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) 
record high or record low was broken in 2015.
•	Watch out for leap days (i.e. February 29th), it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for 
the purpose of this visualization.
